    ## An empty Node.

    Nodes are the building block of Eklips (well, Eklips 4+ atleast). Every Node is inherited off this node class.
    A tree of Nodes make a Scene, A scene is stored as `engine.scene`.
    
    You can make a script have an `_onready(self)` function. This will only run when a Node is fully loaded.
    You can make a script have an `_process(self, delta)` function. This will run every frame after `on_ready()`. The argument `delta` is the delta time variable.
    
    The `self` value in these functions is.. the node the script is attached to. You cannot replace Node functions with a script.

    There is nothing to do with this Node. The only useful thing to do with it is run a script with it, and no more.
